# Gait-Events

PROJECT TITLE/DESCRIPTION:
Gait Analysis Using Wavelet Transformation
Uses gait data from 10 subjects collected by use of two accelerometers and two gyroscopes, with one of each of the chest and one of each on the shank. The code produces plots of angular velocity and acceleration measured by these sensors, labeling the phases of gait, including foot strike, stance, toe-off, and swing. A wavelet transformation is performed on the raw data to provide clearer peaks indicating heel strike. This is depicted in a plot. The same is done for toe-offs. Stance and swing time were computed using points of heel strike and toe-off for each gait cycle. Correlation analyses were performed regarding stance, stride, and swing time for gyroscope versus accelerometer. Finally, a brief power analysis is performed to determine if the sample size was large enough to detect an 80% or higher correlation. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Ensure the script, module, and data are in your directory before running the code.
